# Skeleton for a postgreSQL, fastAPI and React stack application
Setup the base for a smaller project. Mainly wanted to setup the stack for when I can think of something to do, as well as refamiliarize myself with the tools. 
Might do another stack, not sure yet.

Each component is setup within a docker container
